Log:
6hrs: Did not expect to be doing Ludum Dare, this weekend but here we are. Created Project in Unity and modelled units and garden beds for bases, defined unit stats and basic gameplay.
23hrs: First day went okay, lost 2 hours at the end to not understand when Start is called in unity, was causing a crash... starting to work on unit behaviour scripts today



Next: Enemy 'AI' / Unit behaviour scripting


Todo:
base expansions/unit upgrades
Implement unit stats
Environment art


Wishlist:
-unit animations
-sound/music
-UI/graphics suitable for the game/theme
-campaign/multiple levels
